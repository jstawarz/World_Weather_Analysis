# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project

In this project, we are working with Jack and the user interface team at PlanMyTrip. Our assignment is to collect users perferred travel criteria
in order to find an ideal hotel anywhere in the world. Using the current weather, PlanMyTrip will recomend the best place to plan a vacation. The 
data can then be tabulated to provide a list of preferred hotels and mapped to show potential desitations.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project will be to reconfigure the code used in the PlanMyTrip app. The suggested updates will work to create a more
engaging user experience and provide additional information regarding the potential vacation locations.
